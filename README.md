***Abstract***

WHIVE oracle serves as an exchange between HIVE and WHIVE, ERC20 tokens on Ethereum network.

When new deposits with Ethereum address as memo are received, app will mint new WHIVE tokens and sent them to user.
To process the withdraw from WHIVE to HIVE, app generates deposit address for each user with 7 days expiration.

This allows for address reuse and reduce number of addresses to monitor (and later burn deposited WHIVE) to save on ETH fees. To process the WHIVE transfers, app use https://ethplorer.io API.

For v2.0 contract should use custom function that would allow users to directly burn tokens: https://hive.blog/hive/@superoo7/qflf5q

API:

Response format: JSON

`POST` `/create`

Create new conversion (WHIVE -> HIVE) request and ethereum deposit address.

Deposit address reservation will expire in 7 days and address will be reused.

Params: `username` (Hive username)

On error:

`{success: false, message: "error_message"}`

On success:

`{success: true, message: "transaction_created", id: uuid, address: ethereum_address, expiration: javascript_timestamp}`

---

`GET` `/get_addresses`

List all addresses belonging to this project (deposit wallets...), used to verify total supply in circulation, since tokens are not burned immediately to save money on fees.

On error:

`{success: false, message: "error_message"}`

On success:

`{success: true, message: "success", addresses: [array_of_addresses]}`

---

`GET` `/ping`

On success:

`{message: "pong", timestamp: javascript_timestamp}`

How to use `src/utils/deposit_private_keys.js` to generate private keys for deposit addresses?

On success:

`{deposit: config.hiveAccount, minAmount: config.min_amount, maxAmount: maxAmount}`
